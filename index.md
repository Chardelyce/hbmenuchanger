## _Thanks to mikefor20_ on GBATemp

-What it **does** . walks user through changing homebrew menu theme . has links to all tools that are needed tpo perform this operation , and includes the files needed

-What it **does not do** 'install homebrew for you/ set up your micro SD . help you make rom hacks

**INSTRUCTIONS: **

1. Make a working directory. To make it easier you can use this one :)( C:\hbtheme)
2.Grab hactoolnet from the link above  on the tool bar 

3.Extract the hactoolnet archive  you got from the link in to the hbtheme directory that you just made.

4.  Extract your  hbtheme stuff.zip in to the hbtheme directory
5.Place your source.romfs (Skeletal v420 white.romfs from the example zip or whatever you have!) in the hbtheme directory that you made
6. Now that everything is in place let's extract the source theme.
7. Using the included  PAK that came with this application download(should be named "HBThemePaK") 
8.I INCLUDED AN EXTRACTED FOLDER IN THE ZIP. CONTAINING THE FILES FOR MY SKELETAL THEME. YOU CAN USE THAT AND SKIP TO "BUILD YOUR NEW THEME" OR EXTRACT YOUR OWN THEME!.....

9. Drag the theme .romfs file you are extracting on to the "Extract Theme - Drop Theme Romfs Here.bat"
Type a directory name in to extract the Theme to and press ENTER. Leave blank to extract to a folder named EXTRACTED in the current directory
Good job Now Your Theme Is EXTRACTED!

10.The theme files that will be used to build your new theme are all in the EXTRACTED folder. Editing these files will change your theme.

NOTE :You CAN change any of the image files by replacing them with any image named the same and the same size!

Edit the CFG file to alter theme elements color and positioning. Instructions at SwitchBrew  which is linked in toolbar .


NOTE :Make sure your replacement images are the same size, file name and type as the original ones and overwrite the originals!. If you use a different name or image type the CFG file MUST be altered to reflect the new name and type Best to stick with what's there.

**BUILD YOUR NEW THEME \(^ U ^)/**

1. Once you have swapped out the desired images in the C:\hbtheme\extracted\ and C:\hbtheme\extracted\assets\ folders (and altered the CFG if you are brave and or knowledgeable.) Do the following to build your new  theme!:

2. Drag and Drop the entire Theme Folder on to "Build Theme - Drop Theme Folder Here.bat" (Theme folder is the folder you changed the pictures in..hbtheme/extracted if you left defaults)

3. Type in a Name for your new theme's romfs file. (example new.romfs)

4. Type a path to the folder you want the new theme file to output to. Leave it blank to put file in to current folder! (HBtheme if you are following) Then press ENTER.
5. This should pack all the files back in to a romfs file.

**INSTALLING YOUR NEW THEME (OwO;;)**

1. Put your theme.romfs in to SD "\config\nx-hbmenu\themes\
2.Put the SD in your Switch, boot and open HBMenu

3.Press Minus Button (-) to open the "Theme Menu"
4. Select your new theme!
Then that should do it! on switch brew there are many more theme possibilities check them out :)
